## Lab Assignment-1
####  Ques 1: Take a character input from the user. Let a be the ASCII value of the character. Use left shift operator to shift a, k bits to the left, where k (k ≤ 4) is an user input, call it b. Use right shift to shift b, p bits to the right (p ≤ 3) where p is another user input, call it c. Print (a − c).
#### Ques 2: Take a positive integer as user input. Write a code to check if the integer is prime or not. If not, print all the prime factors.
#### Ques 3: Take two positive integers as user input. Check if the integers are co-prime or not. If they are not co-prime, print the largest common factor.
#### Ques 4: Take an integer a as user input. Check a is an Fibonacci number or not. If it is a Fibonacci number, print the previous two Fibonacci numbers. If a is not Fibonacci, print the next Fibonacci number larger than a.
#### Ques 5: Take an integer as user input. Write a program that prints the digits of the integer in reverse.
#### Note: You can use C/ C++. Use tools only up to control structure to write the codes. As an example, do not use string to print the reverse of the input integer.
## Lab Assignment-2
#### Ques 1: Consider integer type variable n. Initialize it with user input. Compute factorial of n, store it in n and print it.
#### Ques 2: Find the greatest common divisor of two integers (user input) by recursive function call.
#### Ques 3: Take two integer type variable a and b. Initialize them with user input. Use reference variable and function call to compute the k-th Fibonacci number where k is the least common multiple of a and b. Print both lcm and the Fibonacci number.
#### Ques 4: Use function overloading to compute roots of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 depending on the type(int or float) of the coefficients a and b. Keep an option of having c as an default parameter.
#### Ques 5: Take an array of size n where n is an user input and n < 100. The array contains integer entries ranging from 0 to 1000. Use random number generator to generate the array entries. Sort the integers in ascending order and print the sorted numbers.
