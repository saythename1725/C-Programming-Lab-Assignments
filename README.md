####  Ques 1: Take a character input from the user. Let a be the ASCII value of the character. Use left shift operator to shift a, k bits to the left, where k (k ≤ 4) is an user input, call it b. Use right shift to shift b, p bits to the right (p ≤ 3) where p is another user input, call it c. Print (a − c).
#### Ques 2: Take a positive integer as user input. Write a code to check if the integer is prime or not. If not, print all the prime factors.
#### Ques 3: Take two positive integers as user input. Check if the integers are co-prime or not. If they are not co-prime, print the largest common factor.
#### Ques 4: Take an integer a as user input. Check a is an Fibonacci number or not. If it is a Fibonacci number, print the previous two Fibonacci numbers. If a is not Fibonacci, print the next Fibonacci number larger than a.
#### Ques 5: Take an integer as user input. Write a program that prints the digits of the integer in reverse.
#### Note: You can use C/ C++. Use tools only up to control structure to write the codes. As an example, do not use string to print the reverse of the input integer.
