#### Take a character input from the user. Let a be the ASCII value of the character. Use left shift operator to shift a, k bits to the left, where k (k ≤ 4) is an user input, #### call it b. Use right shift to shift b, p bits to the right (p ≤ 3) where p is another user input, call it c. Print (a − c).
